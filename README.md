# Instagram_DatabaseSchema_Simulation

An attempt to simulate a part of the Instagram database, for educational purposes 
(in the context of learning SQL programming).

--  There are 7 tables in the schema.
--  Files inside TABLES folder determine the structure of these tables, 
    as well as the relationships between them.
--  Data in each table is entered using the files in the DATA folder.
--  The queries, with the corresponding descriptions, are implemented from the folder QUERIES.
